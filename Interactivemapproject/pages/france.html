            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The Liaison Entre Actions de Développement de l'Économie Rurale (LEADER) program is a participatory development strategy utilized by the EU to decentralize improvements in rural areas. LEADER began in 1991 in a few hundred trial regions, which were all disadvantaged rural areas. Over the course of its lifetime, it has become far more prominent and is now institutionalized in all EU Rural Development Programmes, with member countries being obliged to pay between 2.5-5% of rural development expenditures into the program. The lessons learned over the nearly 35 year history of the program has allowed for the development of thorough strategies and the flowering of associated programs. Most notably, LEADER has empowered local action groups (LAGs) as the main drivers of participation in the program. LAGs comprise of private, public, and civil actors working together on shared tasks. These are naturally formed associations which grow and change over time. LEADER emphasizes strong associations between these </p>

        <!-- Seven Features of LEADER Section -->
        <section id="features-section" class="content-section">
            <h2>Seven Features of LEADER</h2>
        
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>1. Bottom-up Approach</h3>
                <p>LEADER bases its development logic on participatory input from the citizens of the community. It posits that the most adept at determining improvements are those who will also receive the outcomes. The process is entirely participatory from strategy creation, implementation and even higher level aspects like review and evaluation. At the root of this approach are Local Action Groups (LAGs) which pinpoint specific issues and mobilize resources to solve them.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>2. Area-based Approach</h3>
                <p>LEADER targets areas based on certain factors which make them opportunistic for successful development. Instead of selecting a specific goal, say increasing infrastructure in a town, LEADER instead targets the town specifically and all the issues which could encompass it. It does not necessarily seek to impose the developmental strategy on these townships, rather giving them to the tools to pursue their own strategies, different than a project-based approach. The areas must be “small, homogenous, socially and functionally cohesive territory, often characterised by common traditions, a local identity, a sense of belonging or common needs and expectations.” This ideally seeks to facilitate the creation of deep bonds within the community. These areas must also have sufficient resources to be capable of operating these programs [human (10,000-150,000), financial, and land]. The area must also have clearly defined functional borders.</p>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>3. Local Partnerships</h3>
                <p>This is where the participatory engine gains its democratic element. Local partnerships (LAGs) within LEADER take program beneficiaries from the public life, civil life, and from private society. LAGs thus seek to maximize inclusion of community perspectives by involving these groups in the decision-making bodies in which no one sect of the three can comprise more than 49% of the membership. LAGs focus on specific goals, creating plans and mobilizing individuals to act on them. These projects are then funded by the LEADER budget, in the form of grants. LAGs are not permanent and often evolve over time, changing issues as problems arise or as projects are completed to best improve their communities.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>4. Integration</h3>
                <p>LEADER programs are integrated meaning that they involve many various facets of development goals. Integration means facilitating communication between the various Local Development Strategies (LDS), and LAGs to achieve a unified force behind development goals. This integrated approach attempts to achieve more pragmatic decision making regarding development, directing LAGs to target areas which will have more wide ranging benefits to maximize goals. </p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>5. Networking</h3>
                <p>LEADER emphasizes communication and cooperation as essential tools of innovation and information dissemination. Robust communication networks between towns from various project areas contributes to skill development. Additionally, communication facilitates the sharing of ideas and innovations which can then help optimize methods across townships.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>6. Innovation</h3>
                <p>Innovation in LEADER not only seeks to improve development outcomes in villages, but also should serve as a testament to the nature of decentralization: allowing local people to creatively develop new solutions to real problems. Ideally, innovation optimizes resource allocation and skill which can improve outcomes per input, increasing the dollar power. LEADER innovation is often divided into two types: policy and service delivery. Regarding policy it may mean surveying new areas of resources. In terms of service/product delivery it could mean formulating new products or new methodologies. LEADER urges that LAGs pick specific areas to focus on innovation, and recognizes that innovation is a delicate process.</p>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>7. Cooperation</h3>
                <p>Cooperation is integral to LEADER and has transformed over the program history to encompass local, national, or international scales. Cooperation tends to be categorized into two forms domestically: vertical and horizontal. Vertical communication refers to the flow of information between various levels of political organization (municipalities, regional, central governments). This type of communication facilitates the alignment of political and development objectives. Moreover, higher level governments have more tools at their disposal to support projects through data collection, dissemination, and goal setting. On the other hand, horizontal communication refers to communication among different governments of the same level—typically, municipality to municipality. This type of communication helps to augment practices utilized by municipalities through sharing information of innovative procedures. Horizontal communication is seen as vital to improve cost saving and promulgate innovations within LEADER. </p>

        <!-- Takeaways Section -->
        <section id="takeaways-section" class="content-section">
            <h2>Lessons in Decentralization</h2>
            <p>LEADERs method of achieving decentralized development is unique in that it entrusts a significant amount of authority to non-governmental organizations. This idea breaks from the traditional decentralization by devolution methods which emphasize a transition of power between varying levels of government. Despite the fact that LAGs operate within stable liberal democracies with strong municipal authorities, they could be used in cases where decentralization has failed even when de jure authority is given. In these cases, entrusting activities to private entities, which are separate of the political machines could serve to promote positive political pressure.</p>
            <p>While the LAG system has promise in being applied in other areas, it also comes with associated shortcomings. Issues with the LAG system often revolved around three main issues: deadweight and bureaucratic strain, transparency, and plan objectives. Often times, LAGs were not transparently publishing meeting notes regarding proposals, and were not effectively excusing individuals with conflicting interests from the votes. These failures resulted in a skew in the amount of contracts being awarded internally—to people involved in the LAG. Additionally, bureaucratic overload from centralized governments reduced the desire for LAGs to pursue grants. In many cases, grants worth just a few thousand dollars required dozens of pages to be filed for applications. Large bureaucratic load on LAGs attenuated funding opportunities, preventing projects from ever taking off. On the other hand, often times grants were given to LAGs which did not need the funding, either because it would’ve occurred anyway or was already in the process of completion. In total these issues surmount to significant losses which reduce the value of LAGs as a cost effective measure.</p>
            <p>Despite certain shortcomings within LEADER, its unique methodologies can give insight into the formulation of new strategies within developing countries which may struggle with the proper environment to effectively enable decentralization benefits. Effective implementation of LAGs remains contingent on the ability to incentivize participation whilst maintaining transparency and reducing bureaucratic load as much as possible on local groups.</p>
