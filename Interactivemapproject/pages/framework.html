        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Theory proposes diverse impacts of decentralization reforms on the functions of government. Typical arguments in support of decentralization focus around cost effectiveness, increasing accountability, and preference matching. Despite the strong backing of theory decentralization results remain variable, owing to the differences in implementation around the world. Even with great planning, failures in implementation can not only fail to produce desired outcomes but can cause harm to communities.</p>
        <p>Failures in implementation are a feature of the political motivations behind reforms and the culture of government within a country. While the diverse reasons for reforms can often influence implementation, they do not serve as a predictor for end outcomes. A greater predictor may be to analyze the culture of government directly. Government cultures which are dominated by the wealthy, corrupt, and elite gain very little from achieving the implementation of these reforms, even if they exist de jure. In these cases, there is little that can be accomplished through the traditional route of policy. In countries such as these, the institutions of government are managed by pernicious institutions which yield great power over electoral processes. Government failures in these cases yields any traditional route of financial support form the World Bank null, and ultimately a waste. </p>

        <h2>Program Logic</h2>
        <h3>1: Fundamental Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Humans do not vary significantly</li>
            <li>Humans act on perceived self-interest</li>
            <li>Perceived self-interest can be manipulated</li>
            <li>Humans form representative governments</li>
            <li>Governments create and enforce regulations</li>
            <li>Governments' interests can be manipulated</li>
            <li>Governments can manipulate self-interest</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2: Program Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Decentralization reforms generate improvements in life outcomes when there are good government practices</li>
            <li>In countries with responsible and honest government, World Bank intervention helps to implement and plan decentralization frameworks</li>
            <li>In these cases, World Bank intervention improves life outcomes.</li>
            <li>When countries have poor administrative/bureaucratic systems, decentralization reforms are not successfully implemented</li>
            <li>World Bank assistance, despite aiding planning, fails in enabling successful implementation</li>
            <li>World Bank participation wastes resources, and poor implementation reduces life outcomes</li>
            <li>In countries with significant corruption, perceived self-interest of humans has been distorted to make them complacent with power structure</li>
            <li>Self-interest is malleable</li>
            <li>Despite distorted self-interest, individuals still observe some degree of frustration with the government</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3: Bypassing Governments</h3>
        <p><strong>Fundamental Considerations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A: Civil Frustration with Government</li>
            <li>B: Social Contract Theory</li>
            <li>C: Self-interest is malleable</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>A occurs when:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>I: Government inadequately carries out the social contract</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>If B exists and A occurs then:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>I: Frustration has a threshold (T) of government action</li>
            <li>II: Under threshold, status quo occurs</li>
            <li>III: Above threshold, action occurs</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Set X equal the formation of private pro-social agreements then:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>M1: Local communities experience benefit</li>
            <li>M2: People observe changes, and compare them to inadequacy of government</li>
            <li>M3: Continued observation sees A approach T</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>IF M1 materializes but fails to create change => A increases from failed efforts</li>
            <li>IF M1 materializes and succeeds => A increases</li>
            <li>IF A > T, Governments:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>1: Government Concedes, allowing change</li>
                <li>2: Government refuses, increasing A.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>SET V equal to the threshold for violence, which occurs if A is high but does not exceed T due to government unwillingness</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Final Theory:</strong></p>
        <p>IF A exists in governments with B, then if X creates M2—where private improvements exceed municipal ones—A will approach T. When A exceeds T, governments will react. IF T is high, A instead approaches V.</p>

        <h3>4: Explaining Private Partnerships</h3>
        <p>Private partnerships need to be facilitated by a keystone institution, which should be a large institution with the capacity and desire to oversee the proliferation of these private unions, foster their growth, and communicate with development partners. Private partnerships should involve individuals within townships.</p>
